        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>Hello! I'm a beginner web developer. After four years of university and five years of experience working in the financial sector as a data analyst, I discovered that coding is both my strongest technical skill and my greatest passion. I have many years of experience with R, SQL, and SAS, which has given me a strong foundation with which to learn web development.</p>

        <h2>Work Experience</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Capital One: Associate Data Analyst, Business Resource Group Co-Lead (April 2021 - February 2025)
                <ul>
                    <li>My last role in UK Data Analysis was within Tech Transformation, wherein I helped to migrate our suite of reports from SAS to our new python-based system. I was also a co-lead of the Mind Your Mind business resource group, am a Mental Health First Aider, and was a member of the departmental wellbeing team which helps raise awareness of wellbeing initiatives via monthly newsletters.</li>
                    <li>I was the process manager for the Bureau Out process which involved overseeing the carrying out of the process, making updates to confluence process guides and documentation, and migrating the process from Teradata to Snowflake. I have also supported Ask a DA sessions, helping colleagues with SQL and other data-related queries. Other previous experience includes working on risk events and Powercurve (a decision engine).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>Oakbrook Finance: Collections Analyst and Mental Health Champion (November 2019 - April 2021)
                <ul>
                    <li>My role involved working with SQL to monitor and analyse collections performance, produce MI for key stakeholders, provide input on new collections strategies, produce CAIS reports, and help with ad hoc requests from other teams within the company. I was also a Mental Health Champion, and I was part of the team that organised various events and support sessions. This role gave me experience in speaking up to make sure the business is doing the right thing, but also delivering this message in a positive supportive way.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>The University of Nottingham (June 2017 - August 2019)
                <ul>
                    <li>First-year statistics demonstration: During my year as a PhD student I provided support during problems classes and R computing sessions, and marked coursework.</li>
                    <li>Summer Research Internship (8 weeks): I worked on a supervised project based on optimising electricity-based household tasks with respect to  minimising cost, while investigating how this affected power usage.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Skills</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Coding & Data Science Tools
                <ul>
                    <li>R: I have four years of experience at university in utilising R to complete various statistics and optimization based assignments, and during my year as a PhD student I provided support for first-year undergraduate students learning R. I have also used R at Capital One when handling bureau data in some risk events as well as when conducting checks on the data we send to the credit bureaus. When the company migrated from using Teradata SQL (using on-premise data) to Snowflake SQL (using cloud data), I was responsible for adapting the R logic for our Bureau Out process.</li>
                    <li>SQL:  I have over five years of experience using SQL at Oakbrook Finance and Capital One. I have worked on tasks using SQL Server, Teradata SQL, and Snowflake SQL; and have helped to migrate our reporting and campaigns from Teradata to Snowflake, showing I can easily adapt to using different SQL software with differing syntax.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>Problem Solving
                <ul>
                    <li>At Capital One, I have worked on multiple complex risk events that have affected customers which involves working in tandem with another analyst to dual control data regarding the population of affected customers; provide remediation for the customers; and contain the event. Two particularly complex events were the following:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Due to missing data in the CLI (Credit Limit Increase) offer table, there was a potential for customers to receive unaffordable CLIs. Resolving this event involved working with the Data Lake, a rarely used system of data storage, to download historic affordability data and upload it to Snowflake; and adapting the CLI rescind logic to work with historical data instead of business current data. Even though this was an unusual situation I was able to adapt my approach to suit the problem and complete the work by the deadline.</li>
                            <li>Due to a system issue, some application data was erased when agents needed to update some application fields. This led to DM (Decision Modeller) incorrectly accepting some applications and/or granting an unaffordable credit limit. Resolving this event involved adapting the complex DM logic (which neither of us had worked with before) to take in historical data and find the applications that shouldnâ€™t have been granted and/or should have had a lower credit limit, with different versions of the logic to account for historical intent changes. Without careful attention to detail customers and Capital One would have been negatively affected by the unaffordable lending.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>Coding & Data Science Tools
                <ul>
                    <li>At Oakbrook Finance I created and maintained various dashboards monitoring collections, operations, and COVID payment holidays. I would often present the data to relevant stakeholders within operations and collections, and sometimes involved presenting to the CEO. </li>
                    <li>At Capital One, my work within risk events would often involve presenting the population of affected customers to the intent owner(s) and making recommendations for remediation. </li>
                    <li>As the co-lead of Mind Your Mind, the Capital One mental health business resource group, I have hosted many wellbeing sessions that educate and inform colleagues around the business on various aspects of mental health and wellbeing.</li>
