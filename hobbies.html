        <h2>The Charity Gaming Guild</h2>
        <p>Since 2020 I have been heavily involved with a registered charity called the Charity Gaming Guild. As a council member, I help organise and run fundraising events across the country and online, with the money raised going to a nominated beneficiary determined at the yearly AGM. Our largest event each year is a 12 hour Dungeons and Dragons game which last year saw us raise Â£4,165 for Adapt, a charity that supports the families of seriously ill newborns.</p>

        <h2>Singing</h2>
        <p>I started singing in 2022, and am currently the lead singer of a band currently focusing on covers of bands such as Muse, Royal Blood, and Radiohead. From 2023-25 I was a member of the Capital One House Band as a vocalist, and have performed at multiple events.</p>
